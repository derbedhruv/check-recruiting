# Simple script to keep checking recruiting websites for updates
Check the campus hiring websites of big companies for updates on campus events and hiring events. As a Stanford student, there are a lot of opportunities to interview with big (non-tech) companies, and the best way to do this is to go to Stanford recruiting events. Unfortunately, they usually update stuff on their Stanford-specific webpages. I wanted a customized alert system which would inform me when companies post things on their websites and send me an email. 

Another motivation to do this is that I'm not taking any CS courses this quarter and I wanted to keep my coding (Python) skills sharp.
